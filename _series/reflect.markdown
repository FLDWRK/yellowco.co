The turn of our seasons (no matter how much snow or sun you get) holds a rhythm that we not only love, but need. Our souls crave it. Our bodies welcome it. Our minds turn in time with it. And with this cycle brings a much needed space for reflection to appreciate the ending, and welcome this new beginning, refreshed. 

When our time to **[Reflect](https://yellowco.co/blog/2018/12/03/why-you-should-reserve-time-to-reflect/)** is rushed or skipped altogether, January can come as early as an unwelcome alarm clock. But with a careful sweeping of every corner in our minds and hearts, there is a much roomier space available for opportunity to grow, for love to take root, for an entire year of life to happily unfold, in full.
