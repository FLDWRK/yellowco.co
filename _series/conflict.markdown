Every day, conflict arises. We move forward through the morning only to cross injustice on our left, weave through an internal struggle on our right, and run into disappointment and hurt smack in the middle of our path. Though we may attempt to escape it, whether in an effort to keep the peace or avoid the lack thereof, conflict calls for our attention. It calls for untangling.

This month, our goal is to pull back the curtain on conflict. To see it for what it truly is – something to navigate through – rather than avoid out of fear. When we approach conflict with the intent to not just make our point the loudest, but to find where the tangling started, share our perspective, and listen with empathy, there is so much more to gain. More honesty. More resilience. More unconditionality. More of the understanding we’re all really searching for.
