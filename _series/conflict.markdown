Every day, conflict arises. We can cross injustice on our left, weave through an internal struggle on our right, and run straight into disappointment all before the morning is over. Even if we attempt to escape it, conflict calls for our attention. It calls for untangling.

This month, our goal is to pull back the curtain on **[Conflict](yellowco.co/blog/2018/11/05/stop-avoiding-conflict-for-peace/)**. To see it for what it truly is – something to navigate through – rather than avoid out of fear. When we approach conflict with the intent to not just make our point the loudest, but to find where the tangling started, share our perspective, and listen with empathy, there is so much more growth, resilience, and understanding to gain.
