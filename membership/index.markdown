faqs:
- question: Where can I find more information?
  answer: "You can hop on our email list! \U0001F449 [Yellow Membership Interest List](http://eepurl.com/bEZbaH)"
- question: What comes with membership?
  answer: Membership value is delivered in 3 ways. Physically, with a monthly packet
    mailed to your door. Digitally, with access to our online hub of tools, resources
    and digital chats and webcasts. Lastly, in-person. We host monthly in-person gatherings
    with our chapters across the US. If you’re not in a location with an in-person
    chapter, we have digital chapters that meet on Zoom once a month!
- question: Where are your chapters and how do the gatherings work?
  answer: Currently we have chapters in West LA, Downtown LA, Orange County, San Diego,
    Bay Area, New York City, Cincinnati, Austin, Chicago, Denver and Tulsa. The gatherings
    are centered around our focus for the month, but each chapter throws in their
    own flare! The goal is for you to receive your magazine, go through the content
    and the questions, then come together with your group and talk through the focus
    for that month. Every gathering ends with a 'helping circle' where each woman
    has an ask, and each woman commits to helping that person for that month. We always
    leave feeling inspired, having things to think about, and having new goals to
    implement into our lives. They’re pretty awesome if we do say so ourselves.
- question: How much is shipping?
  answer: If you're in the US, We offer free shipping, but international shipping
    prices vary depending on your location. Feel free to chat us below for more info!
