A few weekends ago, our Yellow Co. team took a cozy little roadtrip up to Lake Tahoe for a team retreat at the [Coachman Hotel](https://coachmantahoe.com/)! It was a much needed time of rest, filled with lots of sipping chocolate, hot tubs in the snow, time to read and journal, and some great conversations celebrating the past year and dreaming about the future. 

Every time our Yellow team gets together, whether for a meal, a roadtrip, or even a meeting, there's bound to be some great "table questions" thrown out! They've brought us all into some of the most memorable conversations we've had – ranging from "cry-laughing" hilarious to incredibly vulnerable. Here are a few of the questions we dove into with each other throughout our weekend exploring (aka lounging) around [The Coachman](https://coachmantahoe.com/)!

#### 1. What is one thing you want to carry into this next year, and one thing you want to leave behind?

As 2018 is coming to a close, it was so interesting and inspiring to hear both the big dreams each of us has for the new year, as well as any fears, habits, or thoughts we're ready to let go of. Also recommended: having this conversation while roasting smores over a firepit, surrounded by a snowy winter wonderland! (Yes, we were in heaven.)

#### 2. What's the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to you?

This one turns real hilarious real quick, and always feels best told over some delicious drinks (for us, it was over some morning sipping chocolate in the coziest lobby we've ever seen). We love this as a good go-to for a lighter question that always brings out untold stories. A surprisingly common theme of our answers? Bathing suits unexpectedly falling off.

#### 3. What relationship are you most proud of in your life?

This was a conversation I had yet to ever have, and one that can truly become quite emotional! Even if it's a conscious effort, we don't always take the time to reflect on the work and love we pour into our relationships – whether with our partners, friends, family, or coworkers. I really loved hearing not only what the other ladies valued in their relationships, but the different ways they chose to love someone through struggles.

Here's to many good, real, deep, and hilarious conversations to come in 2019! Many thanks to the [Coachman Hotel](https://coachmantahoe.com/) for hosting us (and our intentional chats)!
