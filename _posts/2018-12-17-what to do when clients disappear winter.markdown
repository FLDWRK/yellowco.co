It’s officially winter, whether you’re somewhere sunny or in the middle of a snowstorm. And… winter means that the holidays are here – if that’s your fancy. It’s dark by 6pm, you’re trying to plan ahead on the holiday shopping, and you may be taking some time off to spend with family or enjoy a break somewhere from your year of hard work. 

It’s a season where physically we can nearly hibernate as humans. Our minds tell us we should be going to bed around 8pm. It’s cold. We’re spending money on giving or vacations. And during all of this change, we begin to find that our clientele slows down significantly. Naturally so, this will happen for many businesses. 

When my husband and I first started growing our coaching and consulting business, I remember this slow season of work. To be completely transparent with you, we face it again and again during this time of my year. At first, this brought with it all the anxious feels. My inner critic kept repeating, “I’m not good enough as a coach,” or, “Finances will be TIGHT this month,” and so on. 

Pushing through that mindset, and finding our confidence and mission in our business –

### We realized that this season isn't about hibernation, nor the clientele we lost, but is about preparation and boosting what we know the world needs. 

It may look like things are slowing down, but in reality – they're speeding up.

### Spring, summer, fall, and winter all have specific roles in the development and leadership of our businesses. 

John Maxwell writes about this so clearly in his book, _Great Leaders Ask Great Questions_. He describes spring as a time for planting. Summer as a time for perspiration and cultivation. Fall as a time for reaping the harvest of your labor. Winter as the season for planning – this is where many of us currently find ourselves. 

As you start planning for a slower season of clientele, I want to unfold three tangible steps you can put into action today, so that you are fully prepared to step into the new year. 

#### Step 1: Change Your Mindset

Your thoughts influence your feelings, which therefore, influence your behaviors. It’s easy for us to get caught up thinking we have nothing to do at the end of our year. Things are slowing down, we find ourselves in the middle of finishing the year and planning the next one, and we can lose focus on the crucial moments that are happening now for our business. Give your mind a deep cleaning daily and change that thought pattern. Set yourself up for success so that your feelings and behaviors follow the present moments that will pave the pathway for your future endeavors.

#### Step 2: Dream, Plan, Create, Write, Boost 

Start thinking of what could be. This is your time to plan how you’ll get there. Goals are set, and visions and dreams are clarified of what success would look like for you. Have an article you want to share with more people? Boost it! Created a new product on Etsy? Share it! Want to set up an event to bring in potential clients and eat good food? Create one! Preparation in this slow season saves you so much more future work so that you are able to jump into the busy season right around the corner. This is the time to have fun, take action, and widen your platform.

#### Step 3: Give Abundantly

Remember that this is a season where you get to have some fun. Inspiration can come from giving what we have, and this goes beyond money. Choose to take a perspective that isn't limited by what you see right in front of you, and instead take a mindset of abundance and trust. Find a need, and give to it. Empower those around you. Know that your voice is valued, and share it with others in a way that only you can.  

If you feel like you’re stuck listening to that inner critic during this season of slower work, don’t give up! These next few weeks are vital for your current and future clientele. 'Tis the season to dream big, create big, and give big – so embrace it.
