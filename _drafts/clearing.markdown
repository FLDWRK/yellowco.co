Today I am excited to share with you a practice that is at the core of our culture at Cafe Gratitude and Gracias Madre. Most of us know, that when we are present we are more available, able to connect and genuinely share with others. Not only is this a great asset when you are in the hospitality business but it makes a difference in all of our relationships. So we put together a practice that drew from a variety of things we had learned and incorporated into our own lives and would fit into a business environment.  We call it “clearing”, and what it does is clear away any distractions that might be in our way of being available to serve. We have kept this as a benefit (done on the clock) for almost 16 years now and the results or benefits are a close-knit community of people who really care about one another, work well together, and uphold our mission of serving love more powerfully. Having the opportunity to practice this at work, they find they have closer, more meaningful relationships in all areas of their lives. 
 
Not asking people to leave their troubles at home, but rather to bring their full selves to work, leaves them feeling valued, seen and heard. They are allowed the time to sit with another person and answer a couple of questions while having that person reflect their responses back to them. We don’t coach, fix or change what someone says, we simply repeat back as verbatim as possible what they shared and then ask them how they feel when they have their attention is on their response. 
This simple, and not easy, practice, frees up the concern or worry they walked in with and supports them in realizing they are not alone. 
 
Here are some examples of the first question; What is the biggest distraction in your life? What would you love to be forgiven for? Where are you mistrusting? Where are you not speaking up? You can see why we nicknamed it “the shadow question.”
 
What is so beautiful about this practice is anyone can do it, because essentially you aren’t doing anything. Which believe it or not, is difficult for human beings. We train our people to simply listen when the question is answered and then to repeat back as verbatim as possible what the other person just said. What is so incredible about this is the person who just shared feels heard. We don’t fix, change or advise one another, we simply listen. 
 
Imagine how good our people get at listening, learning to not react to whatever their co-worker shares, but simply to listen, and then repeat what they shared without adding or subtracting anything. Most of us know our relationships would be in better condition if we were better listeners. 
 
We then ask them to share what emotions or feelings come up when they are focusing on the concern they just shared. 
Once more, the person guiding the clearing just listens. This question allows the person to move from their head, a concept, to their heart, a feeling. Again their response is repeated back to them just the way they shared it. We thank the person for trusting us and for being transparent. 
 
When they are ready we ask them the second question, which if you are familiar with dining at Cafe Gratitude, is also the question of the day that we ask all our guests. The design of this question is to support the person in being present, putting their attention on something they appreciate about their life or are grateful for right now. 
 
The final step is to acknowledge the person. Our view of acknowledgment is not based in something being done, but rather for a way of being, or a quality. We have learned that you can acknowledge anyone for any way of being; kind, supportive, compassionate, generous, loving, and when you do that quality actually arises in them. We know this to be true when you think about it, if someone is criticized frequently, doubt, insecurity and lack of confidence shows up, just as when someone is appreciated, called kind or generous they begin to embody those qualities. Then they switch and the other person gets “cleared.”
 
Here is a link to our clearing instructions so you can actually try it yourself. Be patient, take it step by step and keep practicing, you will experience the difference for yourself.

This practice has created a community that not only works well together but cares for one another. The connection between co-workers is palpable. Our people feel heard, valued and appreciated, which we believe makes all the difference in the quality of their lives. Dip your toe in start acknowledging the people in your family, your business, your circle of friends, and remember to make it for a way of being or quality and watch what happens.
