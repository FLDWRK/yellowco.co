I remember my cubicle days like it was yesterday. The literal and figurative darkness of the season, the lack of hope, fulfillment and joy and the big dream and desire to live for something bigger and more meaningful. It’s the reason why two years into being a full-time entrepreneur I still feel so grateful to get to wake up every single day to do what I love.
 
If you are still in the cubicle (literally or not) and don't want to be, let me talk to you for a second and give you a little bit of hope. I remember when I was in your shoes, feeling like it might never happen for me. I spent two years hustling on my business during evenings and weekends while working full-time, and entrepreneurship just could not come quickly enough. It was like no matter what I did or how hard I worked or how much I planned, I wasn’t hitting my goal to get me out of my job. Everything changed when my health took a turn for the worse. I was so stressed out, I once again found myself at the doctor’s office, I had multiple panic attacks and my anxiety was through the roof. On top of that, I was depressed.
 
It got to the point where I HAD to quit my full-time job for the sake of my own health. At the moment, I remember thinking and feeling like I was too young for this. I remembered a well-known entrepreneur sharing about how her father passed away at a young age from stress. That was not going to be me. Along with the health issues, I felt like God/The Universe was telling me to make the leap. To get out of the boat and walk on water. To jump out of the plane and trust that the parachute would work. So I took a leap of faith and I jumped.
 
### No, I didn’t have any clients. No, I wasn’t making any cash in my business. No, I didn’t have a solid plan.

Now, I’m not writing this to tell you to go quit your job right now. In most cases, I would advise against it. But I want you to hear my story and then I want you to live yours. Here’s what followed:
 
I knew I couldn’t do it alone, so I INVESTED (and I say invested because I wasn’t making money in my business) in a coach and mastermind. I came up with a really good offering to sell (social media management services). I started to engage in Facebook groups and offer my services to those who were looking for it. I didn’t have a website or social media presence or an email list. I was simply focused on selling because we needed my income in order for us to make it. I’d get on the phone with people, offer a solution to their problem, send them a proposal, and onboard them. I walked on water. The parachute worked.
 
I booked up with clients in three months, hired my first employee, doubled my revenue the following month, and alongside my husband, we build our agency to hit six figures year one. It was a leap of faith. An investment. A belief in myself and my business. A survival kind of situation that worked.
 
Listen, everybody’s story is different and I could outline three steps for you, but I don’t believe this is a one size fits all kind of situation. Ultimately, I believe it comes down to you knowing what is best for you, when the right time is for you and trusting that.

### No matter when you do it, it’s going to be a leap of faith. You have to trust what is outside of you, and believe in you.

Here is what I do want to advise you to do when you feel ready (or are getting ready) to make your business your full-time job.

#### Invest in coaching.

I wholeheartedly believe in having a guide/mentor to help you every step of the way. They will advise you, keep you focused, and help you move forward.

#### Have a community.

Just like right now you might be feeling as if you are the only one struggling to go full-time, when you’re full-time you’ll feel like you're the only one struggling to succeed. It’s important to not do this entrepreneurial journey alone. There is nothing stronger than having support and community who gets you at your side.

#### Believe in yourself.

Your mindset is key in this journey. You have to believe in yourself and in your dream more than anyone else. It has to come from within and it has to come from you. If you want an easy daily mindset practice, download these free [business affirmations](https://socialbusinessbosses.com/freeresources) of mine to help you start the day with the right mindset in place.

You’ll know when you’re ready not because of external circumstances but because you, the entrepreneur, the dream holder, will be ready. And when you are, go for it! Make the leap of faith! You’ve got this!
