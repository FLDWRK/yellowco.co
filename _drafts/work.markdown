It’s officially winter whether you’re somewhere sunny or in the middle of a snowstorm. And…winter means that the holidays are here – if that’s your fancy. It’s dark by 6 pm, you’re trying to plan ahead on the holiday shopping, and you may be taking some time off to spend with family or enjoy a break somewhere for your year’s of hard work. 

Winter. It’s a season where we can physically almost hibernate as humans. Our minds tell us we should be going to bed around 8 pm. It’s cold. We’re spending money on giving or vacations. And during all of this change, we begin to find that our clientele slows down significantly. Naturally so, this will happen for many businesses. 

When my husband and I first started growing our coaching and consulting business, I remember this slow season of clientele. To be completely transparent with you, we face it again and again during this time of my year. At first, this brought all the anxious feels. My inner critic kept repeating, “I’m not good enough as a coach” or “Finances will be TIGHT this month”, and so on. 

Pushing through that mindset and finding our confidence and mission in the business, we realized this season wasn’t about hibernation, it’s wasn’t about the clientele we lost, but it’s about preparation and boosting what we know the world needs. It may look like it’s slowing down, but in reality – it’s speeding up (if you choose it).

John Maxwell writes about this so clearly in his book _Great Leaders Ask Great Questions_. Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter all have a role in the development and leadership in our businesses. Since we’re focusing on the winter season, I’ll first briefly describe how he relates the other seasons in our growth. Spring is a time for planting. Summer is a time for perspiration and cultivation. Fall is a time for reaping the harvest of your labor. Winter is the season for planning → this is where many of us currently find ourselves. 

As you start planning for a slower season of clientele – I want to unfold 3 tangible steps you can action today so that you are fully prepared to step into the new year. 

#### Step 1: Change Your Mindset

Your thoughts influence your feelings, which therefore, influence your behaviors. It’s easy for us to get caught up thinking we have nothing to do at the end of our year. Things are slowing down, we find ourselves in the middle of finishing the year and planning the new one, and we can lose focus on the crucial moments that are happening now for our business. Give your mind a deep cleaning wash daily and change that thought pattern. Set yourself up for success so that your feelings and behaviors can follow what you believe is happening now for your future endeavors. 

#### Step 2: Dream, Plan, Create, Write, Boost 

Start thinking of what could be. This is your time to plan how you’ll get there. Goals are set and vision and dreams are clarified of what success would look like for you. Have an article you want to share to more people? Boost! Created a new product on Etsy? Boost! Want to set up an event to bring in potential clients and eat good food? Create! Preparation in this slow season saves you so much more future work so that you are able to jump into the busy season right around the corner. This is the time to have fun, take action, and widen your platform.

#### Step 3: Give Abundantly

Remember that this is a season where you get to have some fun. You’ve put in a lot of work, but it’s not the time to fully hibernate. Inspiration can come from giving more than we have and this goes beyond money. Use a perspective that goes beyond what you know. Find the need and give to it. Empower what you see. Your voice is valued. Your hands are ready to work. 

If you feel like you’re stuck listening to that inner critic and this season has slowed down for you, don’t listen and don’t give up! These next few weeks are vital for your current and future clientele. Tis’ the season to dream big, create big, and give big.
