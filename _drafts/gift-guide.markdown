##### [Grey Labdanum Perfume by Abel](https://us.abelodor.com/shop/grey-labdanum/)

Most people are aware that their skin carries a natural scent-- it's a science to discover exactly which notes in what scents will pull the best characteristics out of your own and blend to create something beautiful and long lasting! Abel has made a science out of doing just that, and has a line of fragrances that evolve to match the chemistry of your skin. Golden Neroli is my favorite spring and summer fragrance (read more about that [here](https://yellowco.co/blog/2018/12/14/16-non-toxic-perfumes-perfect-fragrance/)), but for winter it is hands down Grey Labdanum. It's a fresh and frosty scent, with just enough citrus top notes to balance the deeper patchouli heart notes and labdanum base notes that follow. As it is worn, it evolves from a sharp, clear scent into something smooth and rich. AND-- since all ingredients within Abel's fragrances are 100% natural, (rather than using harsh and potentially toxic ingredients), it safe to wear Abel all day, every day!

##### [The Make Your Own Bundle by Missio](https://www.missiohair.com/shopmissio/custombundle)

As someone with hair that literally falls down past my waist, it's safe to assume that I have tried quite a few hair products. After visiting the marketplace and buying a bottle of Missio's dry shampoo at the 2019 Yellow Conference in LA, it quickly became a necessity. It smells faintly like coconut and keeps your hair fresh, but also gives your hair an amazing lift, which is great for people like me with hair that lays limp and flat! Not only do all of Missio's products smell and work amazing, it's great to know that a product as basic and necessary as shampoo or conditioner is helping in the fight against human trafficking! This Christmas the Yellow Community gets to enjoy 20% off of a special "make your own bundle" that includes shampoo + conditioner + one styling product!

##### [Turmeric Tonic Blend by Golde](https://golde.co/products/golde-turmeric-powder)

The Original GOLDE blend is what I'm giving to my foodie friends - it makes the coziest "Golden Latte" and the nourishing ingredients are also great to cook with. I love adding it to chopped up sweet potatoes popped in the oven with coconut oil, you gotta try it!

#### The Amalia All Weather Boot by Nisolo 

From sandals to boots to heels, Nisolo ethically makes the most quality and comfortable shoes I own. The only problem is in rain or snow which is now solved with these all-weather boots. I might need to gift these to myself this year!

#### [The Caroline Tote by Parker Clay](https://www.parkerclay.com/products/caroline-tote?variant=2125236535317) 

Speaking of quality, Parker Clay bags and goods are made to last and made with purpose by providing sustainable employment for women in Ethiopia. The Caroline Tote, a perfect gift for a wide age range and lifestyles, fits all the necessities and the outside pocket and inside zipper are the icing on the cake. I really value Parker Clay's transparency (learn more about eco-leather [here](https://www.parkerclay.com/collections/sustainable-leather)) and commitment to social change.  Read more about their amazing story in our interview [here](https://yellowco.co/blog/2018/04/11/parker-clay-founder-ethiopia-social-entrepreneur/).

##### [Speckled Ceramic Mug by 31 Bits](https://31bits.com/collections/home-gifts/products/speckled-sand-ceramic-mug?variant=30987083677779)

I believe you can tell a lot about a person by looking at two things- their music choice and their coffee mug ;) If you’re anything like me, the holiday season is defined by my constantly clutching a coffee mug throughout 89% of the day. When something that spends that much time in my hands is ethically made by artisans in Bali, it literally makes my day that much better. This mug is just that, and it’s super cute too! Each mug is a little bit different, as they are each hand made one by one. This mug makes a meaningful and special companion to hang out with you throughout the entire winter season.

##### [Veda Dress by Able](https://www.livefashionable.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/veda-midi-dress?variant=30843713650768)

Every girl needs a simple black dress. If you haven’t yet found your staple, THIS one will change your life. I wore this dress all throughout my pregnancy, and long after. It’s so simple that it makes it easy to dress up with heels and some red lipstick, or dress down with a messy bun and a pair of sandals. It is beyond soft and oh so comfy. I love this dress so much I have literally slept in it multiple times. Not to mention you can feel good wearing it (not just on the outside) because it’s ethically made! A must have for any season of any year.
