Want to actually change people's minds on issues that matter? Don't go to the internet.

I'll never forget the first time I saw MySpace. It was a page that my boyfriend at the time made for his (very emo) band. Anyone else miss the emo / scene days of the 2000s?? I'll never forget him so proudly showing me that their band had fans, random girls were commenting on photos of my boyfriend saying how cute he was and how much they loved their music. "WHAT is THIS??" I instantly felt the 16 year old teenage girl jealousy cloud come over me and hated MySpace instantly. How could it be that these random chicks could tell my boyfriend that they liked his music and thought he was cute?? They don't even KNOW him!

Time went on and, like everyone else, I eventually loved MySpace. It was a perfect venue for me to describe exactly WHO I was, (or who I wanted the world to think I was). I so carefully chose what song I had playing on my profile (the lyrics usually having a secret message to my friends or the guy I liked at the time), I went for an all white, clean template design, and did a photoshoot with my best friend where I morphed my short hair into a mohawk and upped that contrast hard in post. My very first personal branding exercise.

As we all know, the social media-phsere looks a lot different these days. But, just as those random girls commenting on my boyfriend's photos made me mad then, there's a lot of comments, images and words flying around the internet making a lot of us mad today. 

And because we get mad, we post aggressive and mean comments directed towards people we don't even know! We say things behind the screen we wouldn't dare to say to someone in real life. This clip from the Jimmy Fallon show sums this up so hilariously perfectly:

Fans boo a cardboard photo of a Yankee player who then steps out of the cardboard cutout. The reactions are priceless. They immediately stop boo-ing and start fanboy-ing over this guy and go to shake his hand- many of them saying very nice things to his face and acting super embarrassed about their boo-ing.

The thing is, behind a screen (or cardboard cutout), it's so easy to dehumanize people. When we're not interacting face to face, when we don't have to really show up and face the humanity of another person, it's so easy to talk crap, gossip, say mean things, send rude text messages or even create mean memes! 

I think one of the reasons our digital culture is so heated these days is because we don't know what it looks like to have healthy, person to person conflict with one another. We say horrible things to each other behind a screen but don't say anything to each other when we are face to face. Could it be that we have so much anger, bitterness and disappointment towards people we're actually doing life with, that it comes out in other ways- one of them being in the digital space? Could it be that if we learned how to sit down, have difficult conversations with one another in real life, we wouldn't be so inclined to gossip, post rude comments or call people out in the digital realm? Personally, I think so.

I watched and followed the Kavanaugh hearing very closely. I was mortified and so upset with how he was acting, and how some of the senators were acting. I cried tears of sadness and anger when I found out he was voted onto our supreme court. I couldn't believe it. I watched in horror when Susan Collins said she would be voting yes for Kavanaugh. I was in shock, and I didn't understand. 

But truly, what horrified me just as equally, was seeing the internet, people who I supposedly agreed with, tear Susan Collins a part. I saw memes saying she should be raped, tweets telling her to die, and so many other completely dehumanizing and horrible things that no matter what your stance, are not ok to say. This outburst of anger on social media dehumanized Susan Collins, just as Trump dehumanized Christine Ford when he publicly mocked her. No matter what your stance, actions of hate and mockery are not okay.

The truth is, hate creates more hate. When "the internet" (which is actually real life people behind their screens) gets upset, I imagine a sea of piranhas, just tearing the flesh off of another, for their own satisfaction and for their own pleasure.

The truth is, acting like a sea of piranhas or stirring up a political debate on Instagram is not only unkind, but it's just not efficient. The Pew Research Center conducted a study and found that only 14% of people changed their mind or ideas from a social media post or debate. That means that 86% of people don't budge because of something they see on social media. To put it simply - social media is not an efficient way to change people.

So what DOES change people's minds in a true sense? Relationships. Face to face communication. Doing life together type community. This Inc. article talks about research done by UC Berkely and University of Chicago researchers that revealed people respond differently to reading text than they do from hearing words or having conversations. Their conclusion? "This research suggests that the best way for people who disagree with one another to work out their differences and arrive at a better understanding or compromise is by talking to one another, as people used to do at town hall meetings and over the dinner table. But now that so many of our interactions take place over social media, chat, text message, or email, spoken conversation or discussion is increasingly uncommon."

If this is what the facts say, then why is it so difficult for us to have these conversations in person? I think we're out of practice. We've got to do the difficult work of learning to deal with conflict in a human to human sense, and stop dealing with our conflicts in the digital realm. We've got to look past the screen and see the human behind it, because as amounts of good social media arguments have, the damage it creates is lasting and very, very real. 

So real, that according to the Cyberbullying Research Center, 20 percent of victims of cyberbullying reported having suicidal thoughts. This study was done on a 10-19 year old group, but we know that no matter what your age, cyberbullying has lasting impacts. Research shows it can create lasting depression, chronic fatigue, insomnia and poor performance at work. In summary, being mean online has little impact on changing ideas or minds, but a very real, lasting impact on the person it's directed to.

That death threat to Susan Collins will literally do nothing to change her mind, but it could very well impact her emotional and mental health - probably putting her in a worse state to see things clearly and make the right decisions in her line of work. That hate leaves the world in a literally worse state. I truly believe no one wants that and if they could see the lasting impacts of their actions, they would stop.

Part of the reason we're so aggressive online is because we have real bitterness and anger towards the people who have hurt us in real life that we haven't dealt with. Could that death threat to Susan Collins actually be built up anger towards your mother who you never felt acknowledged by or never had a relationship with? Could this anger be dealt with by talking to your mother or if that's not a possibility, talking to a therapist about these deep seeded emotions? I know we're getting deep here, but truly, if you feel the urge to be hateful, mean or just plain impolite to someone online - stop and think about where that emotion is coming from. Is there someone you need to have a difficult conversation with in real life? All of these things can build up agressions and emotions that might be just plain easier to express in the digital realm than in real life. It's important to pay attention to them and then figure out how to express them in a healthy way.

Before I end, I want to make sure that you understand that I'm not saying it isn't okay to be angry or not to post your opinions online. It is SO okay to be angry, and rightfully so. If you want to post about your opinions on your social channels - go right on ahead! I'm only saying that the most effective and lasting way to channel that anger and create real change is by having real life interactions and conversations- not being hateful on the internet.

All in all - we've got to begin the difficult practice of talking to people in real life about our disagreements. Factually speaking, this is the most effective way to change someone's mind and ultimately, change the world. Allow that fear you have to exist, it's not an easy thing to do! But move forward anyway - because the ripple effect you have on the world is a powerful one, and I believe you have what it takes to make it a good one. Now get out there and deal with that conflict face to face! You got this!!
