In the weeks leading up to Yellow Conference, I didn’t know how much I was craving balance, a certain search for “the way back,” or the way home.

“Think about that thing that maybe you haven’t known about yourself in a long time.”

As Yellow Co.’s 6th annual conference came to a close at Hudson Loft this August, founder Joanna Waterfall charged the audience with this. It’s a tender thing to say in a world, or a city, bustling with ambition, on a venue floor of incredibly capable, dynamic women, but it is just the place to say it. This year, the theme of the 2019 Yellow Conference was “Align.” After an insightful, encouraging, and admittedly emotional two days, what I saw in myself and fellow attendees was what I came again for: rejuvenation.

From hurrying (late) into the brightness of Hudson Loft from the L.A. traffic, grabbing a cup of delicious and necessary Verve coffee, I settled into a seat listening to emcee Ingrid Gonzalez welcome everyone and I remembered: Yellow knows how to set the tone. We were in for something great.

Entering my second year at Yellow, Day One felt like a homecoming. Walking in felt like coming home to purpose, and the celebration of it. Great style rules the two floors of conference wonderland, but what’s deeply palpable is a sense of being surrounded by women who are here to do the work, who are _doing_ the work. These women are here to learn, but they’re already making their vocations something soul-entwined, and not just for comfort, the familiar, or the impressive.

They are here to represent their communities, own their failures, remind each other of their triumphs, and learn something new — or come away sparked by something waiting to be found again. Perhaps that thing, as Joanna welcomed us to revisit, would be the transformative belief that by being who we are and doing what we were created to do, we can change the world.

After dance troupe Infinite Flow’s first performance of the conference, Liz Forkin Bohannon opened the speaker series with a manifesto of _Beginner’s Pluck_; that is for dreaming “small” and fighting past believing we have to be “special” to make a difference. In her new book she details her journey founding Sseko Designs. What began as a remixed flip-flop design ignited with a passion to help keep young women in Uganda in school, and open opportunities for them to attend university and pursue career growth. Today, Sseko is an ethical fashion company bridging the gap for talented young women facing a challenging job market and will enable their 131st woman to go to college. In ten years of entrepreneurship, Liz has pretty much gone through it all, and candidly answered our questions about failure, mentorship, and persistence.

Next, Terces Engelhart, founder of Café Gratitude and Gracias Madre stepped up to tell how stories, hopes, and hard work come full circle in when taking the rudimentary step of faith towards our endeavors. Dreaming big starts with the first step, as does calling out the best in the people around us. As Terces shared, “If I call out the best in people, the best will arise.”

Inspired by our first speaker sessions, what was most special to me was experiencing the conference alongside friends and new friends who were here for the first time. Knowing how much the education and the palpable collective passion affected me last year, I was really excited to see what my friends would draw from it, and how it might turn over new discoveries for them.

During our break, attendees were free to roam the Do-Good Goods Marketplace, the Wellness Loft, the Retreat Room, and for the first time, the Nurture Room, specially arranged for mothers to nurse and relax away from the main stage. The presence of these rooms and the attention to detail paid to make them beautiful set a tone: Here, we would regard the whole person, the whole woman, not just our headlining achievements but everything that makes up our worlds.

Peeking through the tote bags of goodies designed with and ethically made by Parker Clay, there was pretty much no amenity overlooked by the Yellow Co. team as each was filled with items benefiting people and planet: nutrient-packed, non-GMO banana chips by Bare Snacks and Tosi cashew Super Bites, and plant-powered, cruelty-free beauty products by Trilogy, Goldfaden MD, and Smartypits. Ethical fashion picks included socks by Richer Poorer and Go Rings’ signature dainty, layered ring. Awaiting breakout sessions, everyone was kept hydrated by refillable bottles of Pathwater and kept caffeinated by Verve drip coffee and cold brew. Upstairs from the annual Do Good Marketplace, the Wellness Loft offered facials by Heyday and polished nails with Restore Blank.

As we recovened for the next session, attendees could opt to take a deeper moment for a breath in a sound bath hosted by Unplug Meditation in the Wellness Loft, or join one of two other breakout sessions. Conversation crossed back and forth from new introductions to well-needed catch-ups and comparing notes on how the talks so far touched on ruts or on progress we had on our minds. My lunch group shared cups of delicious vegan ice cream by Craig’s before breaking off for Quigley’s social media seminar on reverse engineering Instagram engagement (captions first!) and the Align Your Business with Your Values panel hosted by The Good Trade’s founder Amy Ann Caldwell. I headed there with a new friend to hear Beautycounter SVP of Social Mission Lindsay Dahl, Galerie LA founder Dechel McKillian, and Gaia Herbs EVP of Marketing and E-Commerce Elena Lécué. The women broke down how to hone in on the key values for a brand, and how their companies have practically put their values first, forming methodology, strategy, and consumer interaction around those pillars. “Look for the [values] you can’t do your company without,” said Dechel.

Our smaller group in the Bloom Room asked away, from questions about supply chain, to locations, to career path, to wholesale problem-solving. While I didn’t come in with any specific needs, I came away with a refreshed rubric to view values-driven business from women whose experience are showing how it can be done.

Motivation is palpable when you can see what’s truly possible. The Do-Good Goods Marketplace is a wonderland of brands hand-picked and vetted by Yellow for quality, sustainability, supply chain, environmental impact, and more. During these two days, we got to hear directly from marketplace vendors BeautyCounter via Lindsay, Gaia Herbs via Elena, and on Day 2, Barrett Ward, founder of ABLE. But filling the airy first floor of Hudson Loft were tried and true innovators, uncompromising in their values, including nontoxic beauty products by Aether Beauty, dainty baubles by UNCVRD Jewelry, and the cutest t-shirts by HALF UNITED. This year’s official conference themed t-shirt was designed by Dazey LA and worn by Yellow volunteers who kept a full schedule running smoothly!

Rounding everyone back up to the main stage, we sat down to hear from International Justice Mission Creative Director Vera Leung, who showed us how IJM pursues dignity and protection for people through their storytelling. “Our stories are better lived in community; change is only possible with all of us,” she said. Modern slavery picks a fight that will take all of us. Hope isn’t lost for the ones who are most vulnerable. As Vera shared through one rescued boy’s friendship, his vision for hope ignites hers to tell his and many others’ to see IJM’s mission through — end slavery within our lifetime.

Between Yellow’s first New York Conference and this one in Los Angeles, 35 attendees became Freedom Partners committing to give monthly towards IJM’s global efforts. In total, annual giving from the Yellow community has reached $12,816, which will fully fund two complete rescue operations from human trafficking.

To end the first day, the screens on the main stage splashed with a familiar palette of brush strokes and the cadence of encouragement you’ve probably stopped scrolling on Instagram for. Artist, writer, and musician Morgan Harper Nichols entered the stage to show us the very beginnings of how a poem with more honesty than she was ready to share took Pinterest by storm and launched a one-to-one letter writing journey that has proliferated across Instagram. Humble, hilarious, and heartfelt MHN was the real deal.

And just like that, it was a wrap on Day One! We toasted with sustainable natural wines by Dry Farm Wines and bites by Beyond Meat, browsing the marketplace and enjoying each other’s company.

On Day Two, we already had so much to process!

Opening again with emotive, beautiful performances incorporating wheelchair dance by Infinite Flow, today, founder and artistic director Marisa Hamamoto revealed how her own recovery from a stroke’s paralysis struck a passion to create a dance company standing for joyful inclusivity of race, size, age, gender, and disability.

In sharing the story of ABLE, founder Barrett Ward made us laugh and brought us candid truth about the realities of transitioning from a non-profit to a for-profit, and ensuring that the help a do-good business provides puts the community and its needs before its own vision of accomplishment. 

Next, Dressember founder Blythe Hill challenged us to take even what seem like our silly ideas seriously, to have compassion for the simple, enjoyable activities that connect people naturally, and can be mobilized to help others—to break outside our bubbles, ask what breaks our hearts, and confront that as a mission. “Every decision you make can lead to advocacy for other people.”

After so many pages of note-taking, we had much to process just from speaker sessions. But before breaking off for lunch, we took a few minutes to reflect and share some personal practical takeaways with seatmates through questions led by Joanna.

What dreams or goals were stirring for our neighbors? For us, was there something we had buried, but now need to step into?

“What scares you the most about it?” asked Joanna. “If you took a chance on that dream or goal, what’s the worst that could happen?”

The room filled with busy voices. This was a space for messy thoughts and real compassion as we then considered what just one action step could be to move closer to a dream.

For Day Two’s breakout session, my brain really got to work in a session led by Jonathon Murillo of FLDWRK to clarify our mission statement and get to the bottom of that mission’s “problem statement,” the real reason for the mission’s existence. Taking inspiration from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream Speech,” and freshly articulated statements from the audience, the balance he proposed was that between the audacious and the achievable. In that tension is where we create.

A cushion of time allowed me and a friend to compare notes from another breakout session hosted by Ashlee Sikorski. An intermediate Enneagram communication workshop, this one surprised both of us with its focus on the three Enneagram intelligence centers— Heart, Mind, and Body—with each of the nine types practicing another’s way of communicating!

The last two speaker sessions ended our time strong, all of us reuniting to hear from LaRayia Gaston, founder of Lunch On Me, a Los Angeles-based non-profit working for health and mind-body-spirit healing for Angelenos experiencing homelessness. LOM redistributes organic food at risk of being wasted to instead to be served as delicious, quality meals for residents of Skid Row. Convicting and compassionate, LaRayia challenged us to test the purity of our strength of spirit, and to love the vulnerable, the invisible, without reason. “It is a gift to be a powerhouse,” she said. “You can use all of your gifts; you don’t have just one. But start with love.”

To end our time, the amazing MILCK, or Connie Lim, joined Ruthie Lindsey and Miles Adcox for a live podcast recording of The Unspoken Podcast. Through Connie’s personal artistic journey, the three unraveled universally felt struggles of trauma, communication, growth and acceptance. There couldn’t be a better picture of the compassion and unity felt as when the room fell silent for MILCK’s song “Quiet,” and filled with harmony as she invited us to join in.

That united chorus, “I can’t keep quiet…” will be heard in the missions these women take up.

It’s a gift and a privilege to have our hands on the wheel, steering our career paths in a way that aligns with our values. Work can be more than something we do to get by or earn recognition for.

From Liz, we learned that figuring out how to break the mold isn’t rocket science. From Terces, Morgan, and Blythe, we learned to just take the first step; it will lead you to the next.

From Larayia, Barrett, Liz and Vera, we asked ourselves, How can you humbly learn from others about how to truly serve their needs? From MILCK, Miles, and Ruthie, we found the confidence to tell the truth of our journeys so we can mend, and help offer healing to those around us.

“Think about that thing,” Joanna urged in the end, “that thing you haven’t known about yourself in a long time.” For me, it means confidently sharing untold stories, and humbly asking for help to grow. What I gained from Yellow 2019 is reinvigorated hope for what’s possible beyond just me and my abilities. I can own my limits and believe my community’s love and strengths to fill where I lack. Knowing that again feels like a deep breath, ready to make a new first step.
