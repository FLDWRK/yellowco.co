At the end of 2017, I was going through a major business transition and feeling discouraged in my career. The year had started with excitement and anticipation, but was ending in burn-out. I was in the perfect mental and emotional space to take an objective look at myself, so I decided to take a closer look at a personality tool I had been mildly interested in - [the Enneagram](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/). I wanted to discover my blind spots and rekindle my passion so that I could make a bigger impact at work, which made me quickly fall in love with the Enneagram model.

Over the 2017 holidays, I read every Enneagram book I could get my hands on and learned so many fascinating truths about myself. I started to connect the dots about why I liked working with certain people in certain rolls, and why others didn’t mesh. I began to see myself as a unique and fluid individual who was constantly transitioning between stress and security, health and unhealth, strength and weakness. 

### I believe the most important thing you can do this year is better understand yourself and what you uniquely bring to the table. 

So here’s a brief look at each [Enneagram type](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-descriptions/) at work. This is an incredibly general summary of each type, and aspects may resonate more than others depending on where you are in your own personal development journey. I hope it will spark the same interest and curiosity it did in me, and allow you to your strengths and weaknesses in a new way.
