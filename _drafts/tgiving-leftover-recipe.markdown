_Serves 6_

**Ingredients**  
4 medium sweet potatoes  
1 tbsp olive oil  
1/2 cup diced onions  
1/2 cup diced celery  
1/2 cup diced carrots  
3 cloves garlic, minced  
4 1/2 cups prepared brown lentils  
2 15 oz cans diced tomatoes  
2 tbsp tamari or coconut amigos  
1 tbsp basil + more for garnish  
1/2 cup chopped spinach  
2+ tbsp non-dairy milk  
Sea salt and black pepper, to taste

**Instructions**  
1. Cut the sweet potatoes into quarters. You can leave the skin on and it will slide right off once they are cooked. Put them in a large pot of water and boil for about 15-20 minutes until they are soft.  
2. Meanwhile, chop the carrots, onions, and celery into small chunks. Add these to a dutch oven with olive oil and sauté over medium heat for 10 minutes or until soft.  
3. Add the mixed garlic and let sauté for 1 minute.  
4. Add the prepared lentils to the pan and allow these to cook with the veggies for an additional 3 minutes.  
5. Preheat oven to 425°F.  
6. Add the cans of diced tomatoes, with the liquid, along with the basil, spinach and soy sauce to the pan. Let this filling simmer for 10-15 minutes.  
7. When the sweet potatoes are soft, remove them from the heat and drain the water. Remove the skins and mash with a fork. Add some sea salt, black pepper, and splash of non-dairy milk until it reaches a good consistency.  
8. Top the lentil mixture with a layer of sweet potatoes. Bake in the oven for 20 minutes. Allow to cool before serving.
