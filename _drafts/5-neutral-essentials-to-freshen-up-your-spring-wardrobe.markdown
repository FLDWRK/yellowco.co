We're finally here – the season of blooming trees, Sunday picnics, and that lovely-yet-confusing shift of the weather. It seems no matter where you live, spring comes with a handful of equal parts sunshine, gray days, random rainfalls, and even some lingering snow. But if you're anything like me, you've already tried to break out your sundresses and summery, linen shirts at the first sight of a 70 degree day. The best way I've found to dress for any type of spring day, while still feel like I'm ready to frolic through a field of wildflowers? Some truly lovely, versatile pieces in gorgeous neutral shades. If you're looking to freshen up your wardrobe with a few pieces this spring, here are a few favorite, ethically-made essentials of mine that will carry you through this transitional season, all the way through a sun-filled summer.

#### [The Penny Chore Coat by Only Child](https://www.onlychildclothing.com/collections/outerwear/products/penny-chore-coat-in-cotton-canvas)

There are few things I love more than the freedom of not slinging a bag over my shoulder, thanks to some super functional pockets. So it's been no surprise to me that I've been essentially living out of this Chore Coat that has not two, but four, perfectly-sized pockets to carry everything I could need. This has been a great essential to throw on over everything from a springy dress on cooler evenings, to boyfriend jeans and a sweatshirt for just the right amount of polish. The cotton canvas truly goes with everything and has been the perfect finishing touch to pull a light, spring look together. Only Child creates versatile basics with personality in Oakland, designing with sustainability in mind. Each piece is made to order, and they only use natural, environmentally-friendly fibers. Plus, they create a variety of sizes for everyone (this jacket is made for sizes from 0-20)! _(P.S. I'm not saying I've discovered that one pocket can hold whole bottle of wine – but I'm also not saying that it doesn't.)_
