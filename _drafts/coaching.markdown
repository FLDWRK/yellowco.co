Coaching dates back to the 1800s, and some would say even thousands of years ago. There are a variety of “coaching” methods; sports, business, lifestyle, nutrition, science, you name it – there’s most likely a coach for it.
 
Choosing to work with a coach is a great decision, and it’s encouraged individuals take time and thought before hiring the first coach they meet. It’s a proactive step that can achieve massive personal and professional results. Asking yourself if you need a coach? Below are some experiences that may help you identify whether coaching is right for you.
 
#### Are you clear in the direction you should take?

- You’ve created a business model and not sure of your first step.
- You graduated from school and desire to discover what’s next.
- You want to implement a culture of diversity and inclusion in your business and aren’t sure how to get the team on board. 
You may be stuck – who hasn’t been there? Coaches are able to give you strategic guidance into the next step and help guide you into a pace specifically for your needs.
 
#### Is this season filled with contentment or comparison?

- You spend a majority of your time on social media and are unhappy where you’re at. 
- You tend to believe your inner critic more than your truths.
- Your vision is blurry because of the whirlwind happening around you.
- You seem to be focusing more on the negative rather than the positive.
Coaches will guide you to shift your perspective. To challenge the negative thoughts of intimidation and fear, and create positive ones. You will create solid habits in training the mind to shift in moments of darkness.
 
#### Trying to get it all done?

- You’re scaling your business.
- You’re taking care of a family, working a day job, picking up the groceries, and cleaning the house.
- You are trying to complete all the tasks during the day and can’t seem to get it all done fully. 
Through in-depth vision and goal setting, time management skills, and critical focus lists, coaching will assist in obtaining those desired outcomes.
