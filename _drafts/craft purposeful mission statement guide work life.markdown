Raise your hand if you’ve experienced what it feels like to feel unfocused, scattered and questioning every step you take. Girl, I SEE YOU, and you’re definitely not alone. It’s difficult not to experience this in our digital world- so much is being thrown at us on a daily basis it’s hard to sort through all our options and know what direction to take, right?! This results in us feeling scattered, stuck and frustrated. And it SUCKS. No one wants to feel like they’re wasting their precious time on this earth. No one wants to feel a lack of clarity or understanding on the decisions they’re making about the only life they get to live.

Friend, there is good news. Once you’re able to articulate, gain clarity on and define who you are and the value you bring to this world, it gets so much easier to focus on where you should be investing your time.

How do you do that?? SO glad you asked ;) That’s where we come in.

We at Yellow Co. are SO excited to start offering in-depth tools and resources to help you begin the process of better knowing yourself, so you can lead yourself, so you can lead others. We’ll offer tools that introduce clarity, understanding and vision for you to filter both your big and small decisions through. When you know who you are, you can better position yourself with actions that align with your true self-- we’re here to help you do just that.

Our first e-course is releasing exclusively to our Yellow community members at the end of this month! It’s called **“Your Personal Mission Statement: How to Craft a Purposeful Mission Statement to Guide Your Work & Life”**. This course is going to help you find and articulate your personal focus while establishing clarity and alignment for your work. All through developing a personal mission statement. 

What’s a personal mission statement, and why do I need one, you ask? Great question. A personal mission statement is a one-sentence articulation of what you value, your internal motivations, and what success looks like to you personally. A personal mission statement acts as your own exclusive guide to filter your decisions (both work and life) through. This allows you to make sure the path you walk down and the decisions you make are aligned with who you are and the value you bring to the world. It offers you clarity and understanding on your purpose and path. Having this written out in a place you can see it and engage with it on a daily basis is a true game changer.

If you’re feeling stuck, scattered, frustrated or overwhelmed with options, this course will help you slow down, refocus and consciously move yourself to a place that is more aligned with who you are.

You’ll walk out of this course better knowing yourself, how your story integrates with your purpose, and a clear personal mission statement you can write down or print out and put right by your computer.

The course will be launching at the end of October, and will be available exclusively to our members for FREE for a limited time.Yes, members will get this valuable E-Course for FREE for a limited time.
