How to Mindfully Create Your Do-Good Business

As passionate, value-driven women, we want to do good, in life and in business. The problem is, good intentions alone do not protect us from causing harm. We have never been so globally connected, each decision we make when it comes to running our businesses can have a multitude of implications for others. This connection has also brought about more awareness of environmental and social issues. We can craft thoughtful businesses that create good in the world. But to make sure that they are really doing, well, good – critical thinking, honest reflection and research must be pillars of our decision making.

To help you avoid good- or green-washing, I’ve outlined four common business models below and a starter checklist you can run through. 
The Destination Trip

A health and wellness or activity based retreat or where people focus on skill based learning, empowerment exercises or coaching. The trip may have a community or environment component “give-back” and is focused on driving tourism to the region. These can either take place in a destination that haven’t hit the mainstream travel market yet to save on cost and offer an “authentic” experience or in a destination known for retreats and self-development experiences.
A Problematic Case Example:
You create a diving and yoga retreat on an island in Indonesia and the profits help fund a local coral conservation project. But you haven't thought to survey the community where you're running these trips on if they want to embrace the tourism industry, and you haven’t made sure they have the necessary facilities and systems to support tourism. Your trips are a hit and now the community is faced with an influx of people who are creating a bigger strain on their resources. 
Starter Questions:
Have you had feedback and approval from the community and addressed areas of concern? 

Are there any Indigenous peoples land rights or other issues you need to respect and educate yourself on?

Does the community have enough resources and systems (such as waste) to support tourism?
If you’re relying on a trail system, park or reserve, can it handle an increase in visitation without environmental consequences? Is the area already suffering from overtourism?

Are you employing local guides, hosts and instructors? If not, is there a barrier you can help solve (such as funding English classes)?

Are you treating your on the ground employees or contractors with the same standard as your home country, making sure they have health, safety and insurance programs?
The Product for a Cause

A product (or line of products) that the sale of contributes to solutions for a social or environmental cause. With social causes, sometimes for every item purchased a similar item will go to a person in need of the product. With environmental causes, the sale of a product raises funds, sometimes the product is an unrelated item like a bracelet. The item will be heavily branded with a recognizable design so the wearer can show that they have the same values as and support the brand. 
A Problematic Case Example, Social Cause:
You make high-end merino wool toques, with proceeds from the sale of these toques you decide to create a less costly version and donate them to people living on the street. But you haven’t surveyed or collaborated with the support organizations that work within the community. It turns out they are already inundated with clothing donations but what they really need is funding to expand services and programs that help this at-risk population. 
A Problematic Case Example, Environment Cause:
You make beach towels and with every sale, a portion of the profits goes towards an ocean conservation project. But, the beach towels are made of synthetic fibres and contribute to ocean microplastics every time they are washed. 
Starter Questions:
Environmental:
 
Is the production cost to the environment higher than the good it would be doing?
Is the product useful and will it withstand trends or is it likely to end up in a landfill within 5 years' time?
Can you afford to make it of sustainable materials? If you can’t, should you make it at all?
Are you creating a meaningful discussion and opportunities for the consumer to learn more about the issue through the marketing, sale and purchase of the item?

Through the sale of this item are you asking people to buy things they don’t really need, the root cause of many environmental issues?
Social:


If you are supporting people or a community, are you telling their stories? If so, do you have consent? And are you doing it with dignity?
Are you contributing to pollution, unsafe working conditions or unfair wages in another country with the production of your item?
Have you surveyed the community and worked with local groups to find out what they need the most? 
Instead of offering products, could you offer sustainable support (for example, job creation)?

The Artisan Goods Seller

A seller of artisans goods, the wares are often created in the global south and sold to consumers in the global north. Jewelry, textiles, accessories, home goods and clothing are common items, they are usually bought at a lower price and marked up for the western consumer. These re-sell programs can empower women to create an income in unequal opportunity societies. Sometimes you’ll see a portion of profits are also used to set up community programs. 
A Problematic Case Example:
You start an online marketplace and start carrying textiles from weavers in Peru. You share each weavers story hoping to help drive more sales. Without realizing it, instead of focusing on their craft you’ve focused on their personal struggles hoping the consumer will empathize and be more likely to support the artisan. The weavers end up feeling reduced to a stereotype rather than respected as artisans. 
Starter Questions:
Why do you want to work with artisans in another country over the ones in your own community? (If there’s any hint of white saviorism or ego in your answer, it’s time for deeper reflection)

If the artisan is using a design, style or pattern belonging to a culture, are they of that culture or are they appropriating it (using it without permission for personal gain)? 

If the artisan isy are using their culture’s collective intellectual property, how can you support or protect their copyrights so their traditional designs are not ripped off and mass produced? 

If you are using the artisans stories in your marketing are you doing so with consent (true consent, where the person understand the size and potential of the audience) and dignity? 

Is the profit split fair? Are they making a living or above wage?

Have you been careful not to over promise in sales so that the artisan does not invest too much time or materials or discontinuing to sell with other distributors?

Is the artisan still compensated should the business fail?

The Social Impact B Corp

This is probably the most varied out of the models so for this instance we’ll focus on a quality of life improvement product. A company will make a technology that can give people access to clean water, renewable energy, food production or address another challenge in meeting human needs or rights. The company creates a consumer product that funds initiatives to use the same technology in a way that provides a solution to a community’s challenges such as access to clean drinking water. A Problematic Case Example:
You create a filtration system for people who spend time in the backcountry. you employ people only in your country of origin but work in communities in other countries to use the same technology in your consumer product to provide access to clean drinking water. You go on trips to these communities for marketing material photo ops, often with white or “western” looking people posing with POC, the outsider(s) (intentionally or not) look positioned as heros or saviors of the community.
Starter Questions:

Are you or could you employ or fund experts on the ground in the communities you will be running programs or product distribution in?

Are you also running product distribution programs to areas in your own country facing the same issues?

Do you have enough to give away or will you be creating division and contention in a community?

Are you using influencers or prolific people from outside the community to market the brand? Could you be using people from within the community instead?


These questions are meant to get you thinking and exercising mindfulness, but each case will come with it’s own complexities and nuances. Think of yourself as the person being impacted in the economic chain or as the consumer. What would you want to know? What would you want the business to consider? What are the best practices in the industry? It may seem overwhelming at first but when we challenge ourselves to think deeper, we get to the truly good stuff.
