The [2019 Yellow Conference](https://yellowco.co/conference/) is coming QUICK!

We want to make sure you can be there, so today we're sharing everything you need to know to pitch the Yellow Conference to your boss - why it's a worthy investment, what you can bring back to your team afterwards, how it will benefit you as an employee and them as a business, and more!  So gather that courage, go pitch it to your boss, and then [grab your ticket to Yellow](https://yellowco.co/conference/)!

##### Boss Question #1: What is this thing you want to go to?

Answer: It’s called [The Yellow Conference](https://yellowco.co/conference/) and it’s for women who are using their gifts, skills and talents to further the greater good in the world. This is the 6th year this Annual Conference has been put on. It’s a 2-day long event in LA with 500 attendees, 9 speakers, breakout sessions, activations, networking opportunities, a Do-Good Goods Marketplace and interactive activities. They’ve had speakers like Vik Harrison (Co-Founder & Creative Director of [charity:water](https://www.charitywater.org/)), Maggie Doyne (Founder of [BlinkNow Foundation](https://blinknow.org/)), Alexis Jones (Founder of [I Am That Girl](http://www.iamthatgirl.org/) & [ProtectHer](https://protecther.com/)), Caitlin Crosby (Founder of [The Giving Keys](https://www.thegivingkeys.com/)), Sarah Dubbledam (Founder & Editor in Chief of [Darling Magazine](https://darlingmagazine.org/)), Golriz Lucina (Creative Director of [Soul Pancake](http://soulpancake.com/)), [Ruthie Lindsey](http://www.ruthielindsey.com/), and so many other female social trailblazers speak at their conference over the years.

##### Boss Question #2: What are you going to get out of this?

Answer: Overall, the focus is on helping women create meaningful work in the world. Whether that’s through do-good business and entrepreneurship, art, creativity, writing or whatever your ﬁeld of work is. I’m going to leave feeling inspired and more motivated (meaning the amount I’m going to get done on Monday is going to be insane good). I’m going to leave with more tools, resources and advice on how I can (and we can, as a company) integrate more meaning, purpose and social causes into our work culture, systems and processes. I’m also going to leave with some amazing connections with women in the social good space. Which means more partnerships and potential opportunities for us as a company! There’s also a Do-Good Goods Marketplace, which if you let me go, maaaybe I’ll grab you a do-good gift! ;)

##### Boss Question #3: Why do you want to go?

Answer: I know as a company we value making an impact for good and creating meaningful and purposeful work. This is what I’ll learn to do more of and connect with other women who are also working towards the same thing. I want to challenge myself and my current way of thinking, be exposed to new ideas and industry trends, I want to make connections with others in the social good space, and I believe that me attending this conference will beneﬁt our organization as a whole when I come back and implement everything I’ve learned! Aaaand I want to get my holiday shopping done in the Do-Good Goods Marketplace!
