It's that time of year again for thoughtful gift giving, and our team is so excited to share our faves of the season with you! We have so much opportunity during the holidays to be conscious of the impact our purchases have, and to mindfully choose the brands, and products, we want to support. This year, each member on our team has rounded up a few of their favorite items to gift, all from brands that truly inspire, motivate, and excite us by the incredible impact each of them are making in the world. Plus – we have discounts for you to save with for each brand below! Happy holidays & happy thoughtful shopping!

##### [Grey Labdanum Perfume by Abel](https://us.abelodor.com/shop/grey-labdanum/)

Most people are aware that their skin carries a natural scent - so it's truly a science to discover exactly which notes in what perfumes will pull out the best characteristics of your own, and blend to create something beautiful and long lasting! [Abel](https://us.abelodor.com/) has made a science out of doing just that, and has a line of fragrances that evolve to match the chemistry of your skin. Golden Neroli is my favorite spring and summer fragrance (you read more about that [here!](https://yellowco.co/blog/2018/12/14/16-non-toxic-perfumes-perfect-fragrance/)), but for winter, it is hands down [Grey Labdanum](https://us.abelodor.com/shop/grey-labdanum/). It's a fresh and frosty scent, with just enough citrus top notes to balance the deeper patchouli heart notes, and labdanum base notes that follow. As it is worn, it evolves from a sharp, clear scent into something smooth and rich. _And_, since all ingredients within Abel's fragrances are 100% natural (rather than using harsh and potentially toxic ingredients), it safe to wear Abel all day, every day!

##### [The Make Your Own Bundle by Missio](https://www.missiohair.com/shopmissio/custombundle)

As someone with hair that literally falls down past my waist, it's safe to assume that I have tried quite a few hair products. After visiting the marketplace and buying a bottle of [Missio's](https://www.missiohair.com/) dry shampoo at the 2019 Yellow Conference in LA, it quickly became a necessity. It smells faintly like coconut and keeps your hair fresh, but also gives your hair an amazing lift, which is great for people like me who have hair that lays limp and flat! Not only do all of Missio's products smell and work amazing, but it's great to know that a product as basic and necessary as shampoo or conditioner is helping in the fight against human trafficking! This season the Yellow Community gets to enjoy 20% off of a special ["make your own bundle"](https://www.missiohair.com/shopmissio/custombundle) that includes a shampoo, a conditioner, and one styling product of your choice!

##### [Turmeric Tonic Blend by Golde](https://golde.co/products/golde-turmeric-powder)

The [Original Golde blend](https://golde.co/products/golde-turmeric-powder) is what I'm giving to my foodie friends this season. It makes the coziest golden lattes, and has tons of nourishing ingredients that are also great to cook with (turmeric, coconut, ginger, cinnamon, and black pepper to name a few!). I love adding it to chopped up sweet potatoes popped in the oven with coconut oil, smoothies, and so many other dishes – you gotta try it! Golde makes a variety of all natural, superfood-boosted essentials, all of which would make the perfect gift!

#### [The Amalia All Weather Boot by Nisolo](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-9216101-13855541) 

From sandals to boots to heels, [Nisolo](http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-9216101-12504316) ethically makes the most high quality and comfortable shoes I own. With [these all-weather boots](http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-9216101-13855541), any worry of getting caught in the rain or snow is now solved. I might need to gift these to myself this year! Nisolo is a certified B Corp that ethically handcrafts all of their items, and is truly changing the fashion industry (read more on that [here!](https://yellowco.co/blog/2019/11/25/competitors-nisolo-able-movement-transparency-fashion-industry/)).

#### [The Caroline Tote by Parker Clay](https://www.parkerclay.com/products/caroline-tote?variant=2125236535317) 

Speaking of quality, [Parker Clay](https://www.parkerclay.com/) bags and goods are made to last, and made with purpose by providing sustainable employment for women in Ethiopia. [The Caroline Tote](https://www.parkerclay.com/products/caroline-tote?variant=2125236535317), a perfect gift for a wide range of ages and lifestyles, fits all the necessities, with an extra outside pocket and inside zipper that are the icing on the cake. I really value Parker Clay's transparency (learn more about eco-leather [here](https://www.parkerclay.com/collections/sustainable-leather)) and their commitment to social change. Read more about their amazing story in our interview with their founders [here](https://yellowco.co/blog/2018/04/11/parker-clay-founder-ethiopia-social-entrepreneur/).

##### [Speckled Ceramic Mug by 31 Bits](https://31bits.com/collections/home-gifts/products/speckled-sand-ceramic-mug?variant=30987083677779)

I believe you can tell a lot about a person by looking at two things - their music choice and their coffee mug ;). If you’re anything like me, the holiday season is defined by constantly clutching a coffee mug throughout 90% of the day. When something that spends that much time in my hands is ethically made by artisans in Bali, it literally makes my day that much better. This [31 Bits](https://31bits.com/) mug is just that, and it’s super cute too! Each mug is a little bit different, as they are each hand made one by one. [This mug](https://31bits.com/collections/home-gifts/products/speckled-sand-ceramic-mug?variant=30987083677779) makes a meaningful and special companion to hang out with you – or a loved one – throughout the entire winter season.

##### [Veda Dress by ABLE](https://www.livefashionable.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/veda-midi-dress?variant=30843713650768)

Every girl needs a simple black dress. If you haven’t found your staple yet, THIS one will change your life. I wore [this dress](https://www.livefashionable.com/collections/dresses-jumpsuits/products/veda-midi-dress?variant=30843713650768) all throughout my pregnancy, and long after. It’s so simple that it makes it easy to dress up with heels and some red lipstick, or dress down with a messy bun and a pair of sandals. It is beyond soft and oh so comfy. I love this dress so much, I have literally slept in it multiple times. Not to mention, you can feel good wearing it (not just on the outside) because all of [ABLE'S](https://www.livefashionable.com/) products are ethically made! It makes a perfect gift for your friend, sister, or yourself to wear during any season of the year!

##### [Natural Wine by Dry Farm Wines](dryfarmwines.com/yellowco)

Anyone who knows me knows I love a good glass of wine – whether over dinner with friends, to sip on while cooking, or to bring along to any holiday party. Over the years I've tried more and more natural wines, and I truly can't go back. To me, the taste is _so_ much cleaner, smoother, and of course, safer to drink knowing that Dry Farm Wines are all natural, and are free of additives and added sugar. One of their wine boxes would make an absolutely perfect gift for any wine-lover you know.

![ASARAI_3.jpg](/uploads/ASARAI_3.jpg)

##### [Australian Red Clay Face Mask by Asarai](https://www.asarai.com/products/earth-tones-mask)

I tend to be picky about many things, but skincare is definitely at the top of the list. After testing out many different brands over the years (and having some scary results along the way), once I find great quality, affordable products that work, you better believe I'm sticking with them. This clay mask by Asarai is natural, fragrance-free, toxin-free, and seriously leaves your face glowing and _so_ soft. I've loved adding it into my routine (you only leave it on for about 10 minutes!) and would highly recommend gifting it to someone you love (or yourself!) this season.
