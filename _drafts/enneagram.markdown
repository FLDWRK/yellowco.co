Conflict and the Enneagram 


So, you’re in a group of of your closest friends and say, “I think Kanye West should be the next President.” How do you imagine each of them responding in this scenario?

Maybe some laughingly agree. Maybe some instantly get riled up and start emphatically stating why that’s not true. Maybe some find the idea of Kanye’s America fascinating and worthy of exploration. Maybe some see conflict building in the group and instantly start trying to keep the peace.

Now, I’ve never actually said that in a group of people, but I have seen similar responses when conflict arises in a group. People hunker down into certain roles based on their values and personalities.

That’s where knowing the enneagram comes in. Many people talk about the enneagram these days, but, for those of you who might be less familiar, stated at its simplest the enneagram is an ancient and (in my experience) amazingly accurate personality framework that separates people into 9 core types based on desires and fears. These desires and fears are a mix of nature (what we were born with) and nurture (ways we learned to cope with unmet childhood needs. Yes, even if you had wonderful parents). 

I like to say that the enneagram makes up .002% of a person, if that. I say this because a lot of folks who like the enneagram like to assume people are their number: “I’m a 9! What are you?” But there is so much more to a human being beyond their personality--what they believe about the world or the culture they are born into, for instance.

Anyway, I’ve discovered the enneagram to be especially helpful when it comes to conflict. The reason for this is that conflict is usually healthfully resolved when two people come to the place where each realizes she is an imperfect human being and that her opinions and beliefs are deeply intertwined with that flawed humanity. 

The enneagram teaches that each of the 9 types has their own “psychological and cyclical trap,” and that trap plays out in all relationships, discussions, and situations except for when enough time and effort has been put in to overcome it. And though most people like quick fixes and sometimes see slight glimmers outside of their personality’s traps, it’s usually the case that an entire life’s worth of emotional and psychological work goes into ever truly breaking this cycle in a more complete way.

Anyway, here is where we dive in. Thanks for staying with me reader, I promise there will be payoff. [Here is a link](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-descriptions) to each of the nine types descriptions if you want more context. Below, I’m going to list briefly how each of the nine types gets into and handles conflict, and then I’m going to point out some ways the enneagram can be useful for healthfully navigating these types of conflict. Here we go:

Type Ones desire integrity and goodness. For ones, the principle of the situation is foremost, and a type one will act differently depending on what they think is right or wrong in the situation. An example of conflict for this type could look like the type one stuffing down feelings of frustration toward the other with the mindset, “I shouldn’t be having these thoughts; they are bad.” Ones are often trying to be good and do things right. But a healthy version of someone who falls into the traps of a one will see that by engaging in conflict and admitting their own less admirable feelings and qualities, instead of eventually exploding with anger, they can gently diffuse life’s conflicts one situation at a time as they come up.

Type Twos desire to be loved and cared for by those around them. Conflict for a type two will often arise because of the inherent conflict between catering to their own needs versus the perceived needs of their family, friends, and coworkers. A two falls into the pattern of “giving to get” and those around them can pick up on this. A healthy version of a two will learn how to take care of their own needs before getting into tricky situations of giving love to others that don’t necessarily want what they’re giving in that specific way at that specific time. 

Type Threes desire standing out and being considered highly successful. Conflict for a three will often come up when a three is deciding between speaking their own truth or living out the values/truth of the people-groups and the culture around them. A healthy version of someone with type three tendencies will eventually learn to challenge the group’s definition of success and find that by speaking their own truth, they are actually more attractive. 

Type Fours desire expression and authenticity. Conflict for a type four will often look like intense daily feelings that they exist in a world which does not understand them. Fours can get trapped thinking that they are the only person experiencing emotional suffering, or at least to that depth. A healthy version of a four is able to leave their own “ocean of emotion” and share their strength of ‘suffering well’ with those around them.  

Type Fives desire privacy and knowledge. Conflict for a five will often look like how they go about their relationships: a push and pull, always desiring more space and time away and yet deep down desiring intimacy. A healthy version of a five will relinquish this control and let whatever come their way, come. 

Type Sixes desire security. Conflict for a six: do I listen to voices in my head or follow my gut? How do I follow my gut? How do I trust this person? This group? Do I do it wholeheartedly or not at all? Sixes are constantly questioning and can be in a state of constant fight or flight mode. A healthy version of a six becomes courageous enough to move out of their head and into their gut, trusting their instincts and overanalyzing less.

Type Sevens desire savoring life's best experiences. Conflict for a type seven will often look like wanting to do too much all the time, because it is all so good! A healthy version of a type seven slows down in order to not run away from the what feels like a constricting present reality, truly savoring just one thing at a time. 

Type Eights desire intensity. Conflict for this type will often look firey and easy to access. True, engaging in conflict, per se, is easy for an eight, but not vulnerability. Eight’s have a tough exterior, but it is because they are scared to be seen as weak. Eights get themselves in a lot of obvious situations of conflict, and I think we can learn a lot from their energy. A healthy version of a type eight looks like weapons dropped and vulnerability shown. 

Type Nines desire harmony and are the most conflict avoidant out of each of the nine enneagram types. Conflict for a nine often shows up in the form of indecision. Their superpower is seeing all sides to everything, leaving them in a state of constant ambivalence. The best version of a type nine is unstoppable, showing up to her life agenda. 




If you don’t know your core type and want to put in the work, read through the nine type descriptions. Discuss with safe people, a coach, counselor, or mentor. Extracted from Alexander pope famous poem, “a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.” If you plan to use the enneagram it takes time, study, reflection, humility, and the awareness that it’s not a “feel good” personality test. If you are ready to put in the hard work, I think it’s worth it! -Ashlee 

So that is how each number typically gets into and handles conflict. Here are a few ways, I as a coach have found the enneagram useful for for groups or clients who are navigating conflict in their lives, or in places I’ve experienced conflict.

Empathy

If anything, I think studying the enneagram can give us a tremendous sense of empathy for the other. We can look at each type’s hang-ups and blind spots to life and truly feel for them. ‘Dang I thought it was hard being me; it looks like it’s hard being you too!’ The enneagram shows us that whatever the personality, each of us has our own struggles and dilemmas we face when we engage in any given situation. Knowing our patterns and the ones of those we’re in conflict with can help us have a huge sense of warmth and caring toward what that person is experiencing. 

       2. Humility

If each of us has our own psychological trap and obsession, how can any one of us be extremely judgmental toward someone else. In my experience, when a client has true humility, she or he is able to enter conflict and make it about the situation, not the person. Also, the reason conflicts become so aggressive and intense is because people have psychological triggers or perceptions that have almost nothing to do with the issue. For example, when my husband leaves dirty dishes all over the counter, and I get angry with him because I don’t feel cared for. When I realize it’s not about the dishes, we can start to have a conversation about me feeling like he’s not thoughtful toward me.

      3. Unity

It can be immensely comforting to know others have similar worries and desires as yourself. Being able to talk to others who experience the world similarly and hearing how they overcome some of their traps can help you overcome yours too. Also, when we are able to see others’ strengths that are not our own, we can ask them for help seeing the world differently. 


Lastly, I want to recommend a couple things. I believe conflict can be one of the best ways we grow. If you haven’t had counseling or been coached, I’d highly recommend it. The space is giving you an ombudsperson to help sort through relationships and process what you are feeling and how to move forward. 

Another tool I find especially helpful is the [Enneagram Institute relationship pairings](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/the-enneagram-type-combinations/) where you can see how two types in relationship play out. I have been with my spouse for 7 years and we have always known about the enneagram--seeing our patterns play out is eery when read, as it’s able to be condensed in a paragraph and can look the same for us in very different seasons of life. Having this language to deal with conflict has been a great resource to us. Ultimately my husband and I end up reading up about each type and can see the other’s rough edges. One of our phrases we say to one another when admitting we’re having conflict is “It seems like this is just my rough edges rubbing against yours.” 

I have a friend who describes conflict as a rock tumbler. These jagged, brownish gray rocks go in and they come out soft and with all these unknown amazing colors like teal and pink! There is some tumbling that happens in between but nothing someone can’t handle. My hope for you, reader, is that you lean into self-awareness and ask what are some next steps you want to take. Maybe it’s talking to your boss or picking up an enneagram book. Whatever it is, keep the course and do the heart-work. You are worth it.
