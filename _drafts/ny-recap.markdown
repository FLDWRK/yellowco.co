Is there anything better than a group of entrepreneurial women coming together on a Friday to pursue their own growth and connect with other business babes? Having attended the [LA Yellow Conference](https://yellowcollective.lpages.co/yellow-conference-2019/) a few years ago, I was very excited to experience the very first Yellow Conference in NYC. The morning started off bright and early at [501 Union](http://www.501union.com/#home) (incredibly beautiful space!) in Brooklyn where 200 women gathered in anticipation for the day’s events. After an incredible, emotion-evoking dance that left us all in awe and even more excited for what the day had in store, founder Joanna Waterfall (virtually) took the stage via video to welcome us. Even though she expressed her deep sense of FOMO for not being able to join in person, she shared how she (quite literally) has her hands full with her sweet newborn. 

The conference’s theme was **Create Meaningful Work**. 

### Consistently throughout the day we were presented with the idea that while we are not defined by what we do, when we align our work with who we are, powerful impact happens. 

A few of my other favorite takeaways from the day: As entrepreneurs, we are givers, so we need to self care in a way that brings life and creativity to our work. And finally, work isn’t a career – it’s how you find and create meaning in this world.

Next up, [Cassandra Bianco](https://www.instagram.com/cnbianco/) led us in a short, calming meditation to set aside the demands of life and business in order to be present. The speaker lineup began with the [Reverend Jacqueline J. Lewis PH.D.](http://www.jacquijlewis.com/) who inspired us to rise up and take our place in the love “revolution”. She shared how when we do the work to embody the many kinds of love, we are able to let go of the things from the past that distract us from our purpose. 

### “If we are agents of healing and redemption, we can rewrite the world.” - Reverend Jacqueline J. Lewis PH.D.

Feeling motivated to carry our impact with even greater responsibility, we were ready to get down to business. [Vik Harrison](https://www.instagram.com/vikharrison/), Co-Founder and Creative Director of [charity:water](https://www.charitywater.org/) and Founder of [The Branded Startup](https://www.thebrandedstartup.com/), took it away with actionable tips on how to incorporate storytelling into marketing strategies. As Vik said – the bigger the transformation in the narrative, the better the story will connect with human beings who feel inspired to hope, or compelled to change. 

After a short break, [Vera Leung](https://www.instagram.com/veraleung/), Creative Director at [International Justice Mission](https://www.ijm.org/), brought Vik’s point to life by sharing a personal interaction she had with a 7-year-old boy named Maarko in Thailand that IJM had rescued from cybertrafficking. In honor of making every person feel seen and loved in the midst of their suffering, we blew bubbles like she had in her story with Maarko. 

“Tell stories that help people see the inherent wonder in the lives of people who have been abused and in violence.” - Vera Leung

After her powerful talk, we refueled with delicious social impact coffee provided by Think Coffee and delicious organic plant-based drinks from Rebbl, and had some time to peruse Yellow's Do-Good Goods Marketplace! Some of my personal favorite vendors included hormone balancing sweet treats from [Moon Cycle Bakery](https://www.mooncyclebakery.com/), canvas and leather give-back bags from [FEED](https://feedprojects.com/), handmade clay earrings from [Mazí](https://www.shopmazi.com/), and all the superfood honey goodies from [Beekeeper's Naturals](https://beekeepersnaturals.com/). 

I couldn't stand to wait any longer to get a sneak peek into our fully-stocked goodie bags, so took a moment here to check out the socially conscious products they were filled with! The darling [canvas tote itself was ethically made](https://yellowco.co/blog/2019/05/10/impact-artisans-world-earn-fair-wage-interview-global-goods-partners/) by [Global Goods Partners](https://globalgoodspartners.org/)! Inside it held everything from the cutest breezy, eco-friendly blouse from [The Summer House](https://thesummerhouse.in/collections/clothing), an ethically made leather cord taco from [Parker Clay](https://www.parkerclay.com/), on-the-go sustainable coffee thermos from [Hip](https://be-hip.com/index.html), and a lovely, natural hydrating rose water toner from [Trilogy](https://www.trilogyproducts.com/us/). I couldn’t wait to delve deeper into the bag, but before we knew it the Female Founders Panel was assembling and drew our attention back to the stage. 

We were met with the ultimate lady bosses: Lauren Bush Lauren, CEO, Creative Director, & Co-Founder of FEED Projects, Theresa and Corinna Williams, Co-Founders of Celsious, and Lauren Singer, Founder & CEO of Package Free Shop. The panel was facilitated by none other than Colleen Wachob, Co-Founder & Co-CEO of mindbodygreen, who drew out nuggets of wisdom through questions. Women across the room were hastily jotting down notes full of actionable items to turn around and implement into a business structure, hiring strategy, personal time, and collaborative partnerships. 

Would there really be a Yellow Conference without the opportunity to connect through an attendee activity? The volume of the room rose with a buzz of voices as everyone discussed thought-provoking prompts. To wrap up the day, Mari Andrew, writer & illustrator, chatted with Rachael Baxter, Co-Founder of Conscious Magazine (also in our swag bags!), in a live-podcast style conversation. For as many followers as Mari has on Instagram (million+), you would never know from her relatable personality and genuine story. It was a wonderful reminder as we wrapped up the day to give the most authentic expression of ourselves to the work that we do.

“The best art inspires people to not be like you, but inspires people to be like themselves.” - Mari Andrew

Throughout the day there were many times I scanned the room and felt so inspired to be in such a beautiful space as so many social good trailblazers. Whether it was connecting with new friends or seeing other women find common ground over similar interests, the general atmosphere encouraged transparency and empowerment. Traveling from all over to be attend, it was amazing to know that we were surrounded with fellow boss ladies who took the time to invest in personal growth that will be carried back into business.
