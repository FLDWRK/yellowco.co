Jenny Nuccio is the Founder and President of Imani Collective â€” a non-profit, woman-empowerment program focused on defeating generational poverty through education and employment opportunities in Mombasa, Kenya and surrounding communities. Most days you can find her laughing with her kiddos, wondering the streets of Mombasa, or simply enjoying a great cup of Kenyan coffee. She loves serving the world by spreading love, hope and inspiration through all realms of life.
