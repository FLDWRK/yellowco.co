Terces Engelhart shares from her heart making sure people donâ€™t miss who they really are. Her love and acceptance is welcoming and her joy infectious. Her own journey, from sexual abuse and twenty years of an eating disorder, empowers her message with real life experiences. Her intimate relationship with a loving internal power, that led to her healing, is inspiring. When not on the road speaking and teaching, she lives with her husband, Matthew, in Vacaville California on their regenerative farm. She and her husband are the founders of Cafe Gratitude and Gracias Madre, plant based restaurants. Together they have five grown children and thirteen grandchildren.
