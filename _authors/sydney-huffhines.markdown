Sydney is always in the mood for a latte paired with conversation. She’s passionate about women’s health, the great outdoors, and a good non-toxic face mask. Being a mama is her main gig, and she hopes to become a nurse, with the intention of blending her love for accessible holistic health with caring for people well. She lives in the Midwest with her husband and their son.
