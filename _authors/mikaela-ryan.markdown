Mikaela Ryan considers Trader Joe’s grocery shopping to be her most serious hobby. But when she’s not debating the merits of dark chocolate PB cups vs. dark chocolate covered almonds, she runs digital marketing for a DC-based think tank and is the founder and editor of Mira, a news media company. She can be found: chronically listening to podcasts, obsessing over AirBnb listings, and communicating ideas with beauty.
