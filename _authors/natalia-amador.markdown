Natalia Amador is a Business + Online Marketing Coach who helps women launch and scale profitable online businesses that are designed around their dream life. She is a lover of cheesy jokes, the best guacamole-maker you’ll ever meet, and loves finding ways to give back and make a difference in the world. When she isn’t helping others build their dream business online, she enjoys doing some creative writing while drinking freshly brewed cups of cafecito (coffee), shopping, and cooking. She currently resides in Los Angeles, CA, where she was born and raised. You can learn more about her and how to work with her at [socialbusinessbosses.com](https://socialbusinessbosses.com/).
