Liv knows how to hustle. Not only is she an associate attorney and the communications director at the law firm wilkmazz PC, she’s also the creative director of Hot Fire Social, a boutique branding agency she co-founded with her business partner, Steph Trejos. When asked why she works two jobs, she said, “Well, the dog’s not going to put himself through college.”
