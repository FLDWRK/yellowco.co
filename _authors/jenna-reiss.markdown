Jenna is a Breathwork Meditation Coach supporting people in discerning what they want to do, create, or change in their lives through Breathwork, Meditation, and Intuitive Coaching. She teaches private, corporate, groups, and conferences working with people to break free from old patterns and habitual ways of being, and connect with their authentic selves again. She believes everyone deserves to be their most authentic self, to be the best version they can possibly be, all day everyday.
