Danielle Doby is a storyteller, artist, and author of the book, _I Am Her Tribe_. Danielle believes that our stories are the keys that open the door to hope in others. The meeting place where the truth finds the light. She writes for her own healing. She shares to meet her courage. The magic happens when someone else sees their reflection in the words.
