A photographer who never expected to be one, Andrea thought she would be an optometrist or a dancer. She’s an ESFP who spends a good amount of time alone and loves it. Andrea hates planes, but the love for globe-trotting outweighs the fear. Aside from weddings and portraits, she’s passionate about documenting stories that bring awareness to human issues and telling the stories of other movers and shakers.
